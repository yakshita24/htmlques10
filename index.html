    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 234);" > Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres and her narrative songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical praise and widespread media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country singer to write or co-write a US platinum-certified album entirely.

        Swift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" were the first country songs to respectively top the US pop and all-genre airplay charts. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and eschewed her country identity for her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017), which spawned the number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".
        
        Departing from Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). Her input during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the indie folk and alternative rock albums Folklore and Evermore (2020), whose lead singles "Cardigan" and "Willow" topped the Hot 100. She began re-recording her Big Machine catalog following a dispute over the albums' masters, re-releasing Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) in 2021. The latter's "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" became the longest Hot 100 chart-topper ever. Her tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), broke streaming records and marked Swift's fifth album to open with over one million copies sold in the US. Swift has directed the music films Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in other films.

        Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Her accolades include 11 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; 34 American Music Awards, the most for an act; 29 Billboard Music Awards, the most for a woman; and an Emmy Award. She has featured on rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her music is credited with influencing a generation of singer-songwriters.</p>
