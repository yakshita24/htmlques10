    <p  style="color: rgb(224, 215, 215) ;">Swift's net worth is $570 million, per a 2022 Forbes estimate. Additionally, her publication rights over her first six albums are valued at $200 million.[598] From 2011 to 2020, she appeared in the top three of the Forbes Top-Earning Women in Music list, topping it in 2016 and 2019.[599][600] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by the Guinness World Records as the highest annual earnings ever for a female musician,[601] which she herself surpassed with $185 million in 2019.[602] Overall, Swift was the highest paid female artist of the 2010s decade, earning $825 million.[603] She has invested in a real estate portfolio worth $84 million,[604] including the Samuel Goldwyn Estate in Beverly Hills, California;[604] the High Watch in Watch Hill, Rhode Island;[605] and multiple adjacent purchases in Tribeca, Manhattan, nicknamed as "Taybeca" by local realtors.[606]</p>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(230, 223, 223) ;">Tours:</h1>
    <p style="color: rgb(225, 164, 164) ;">American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has headlined five concert tours and three one-off concerts, and performed in 21 music festivals and 197 live events. She first promoted her debut album Taylor Swift, in 2006 and 2007, through performances at several award ceremonies and television shows, including the 42nd ACM Awards and Good Morning America.[1] She then served as an opening act for Rascal Flatts (2006),[2] George Strait (2007),[3] Kenny Chesney (2007),[4] Brad Paisley (2007–08),[5][6] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's joint tour (2007).[7]

        In 2009 she embarked on her debut concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which visited North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, and grossed over $63 million.[8] She embarked on the Speak Now World Tour in 2011, which visited Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. At the end of 2011, the tour was placed fourth on Pollstar's annual "Top 25 Worldwide Tours", earning $104.2 million with 100 shows.[9] This made it the highest-grossing tour for a female artist and for a solo artist in 2011. The tour ended in March 2012, and grossed over $123 million.[10]
        
        Swift's next tours broke world records, with the 2013–14 The Red Tour grossing $150 million, becoming the highest-grossing tour by a country artist in history.[11] The 1989 World Tour (2015) became Swift's highest grossing and most attended tour at the time, mobilizing 2,278,647 fans and grossing over US$250 million. It became the highest-grossing tour in 2015,[12] as well as one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade.[13] The 1989 World Tour grossed over US$199.4 million in North America alone, breaking the previous all-time high of $162 million set by The Rolling Stones in 2005, and Swift became the first female artist in music history to do so.[14] With her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour, she topped her own gross and attendance counts set during The 1989 World Tour, with a $14 million take from 107,550 sold tickets at Levi's Stadium.[15] In North America, it grossed $202.3 million, thus breaking Swift's own record of the highest-grossing tour by a female artist in that continent, previously held by The 1989 World Tour, with fewer dates.[16] The Reputation Stadium Tour also broke the record for the highest-grossing US tour of all time.[17]
        
        Swift's planned sixth tour, Lover Fest, was set to visit stadiums and music festivals beginning on April 5, 2020,[18] but was canceled following the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.[19] The Eras Tour will begin in March 2023.</p>
